                a: "Kartcade is Oregon's first racing simulator lounge, offering 9 racing simulators and 1 flight simulator with an incredible variety of games. Unlike traditional sim racing centers, we celebrate all types of driving experiences from hardcore simulation to arcade fun."

                q: "What should I wear?",
                a: "Wear comfortable clothing and CLEAN closed-toe shoes with flat soles. Racing shoes aren't necessary, but avoid flip-flops, high heels, or anything that might slip off the pedals."

                q: "Can I walk in, or do I need to book?",

                a: "We recommend ages 8 and up for the racing karts, and ages 10+ for the full-size rigs. The motion simulator is recommended for ages 12+ due to intensity. All minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian."
            },
            {
                q: "Is there a height requirement?",
                a: "For the racing karts: minimum 4'0\". For full-size rigs: minimum 4'8\". Maximum: about 6'6\" and 300 lbs for comfort."

                q: "Can I play games not on your list?",
                a: "Maybe! We take requests seriously and can often add games if they work with our equipment. Configuration may require some time, so if you give us enough notice, we can have it ready for you when you arrive."

            {
                q: "Do you have multiplayer racing?",

            },
            {
                q: "How realistic are the simulators?",
                a: "It depends on the game! Titles like Assetto Corsa, Le Mans Ultimate and Dirt Rally 2.0 are incredibly realistic with professional-grade physics. Games like Wreckfest and Grid Legends are more arcade-style but still use realistic steering and control. We have options across the full spectrum. The motion simulator adds a level of immersion that makes you feel like you're in the car!"

                q: "How does pricing work?",
                a: "Pricing is per person, not per simulator. This means everyone in your group gets their own rig to race simultaneously—no taking turns! Rates start at $25/hour for adults and $20/hour for youth on karts."
            },
